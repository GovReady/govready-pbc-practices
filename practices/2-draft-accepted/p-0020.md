## About this Document

This document is cleared for public release. 

[The official version of this document will be available at http://govready.com/practices/p-0020/.]


## Purpose
This Practice:

* describes GovReady PBC's risk management strategy that includes unambiguous statement of the organization's
  * risk concerns
  * prioritized assets 
  * risk tolerance
* establishes the NIST RMF (RMF) as the approach to managing risk in GovReady PBC information technology systems
* establishing associated cybersecurity policy
* assigns organization responsibilities for executing and maintaining GovReady's tailoring and implementation RMF


## Practice

## Knowledge Sharing

GovReady PBC's community of staff, customers, suppliers, and extended community need ready access to GovReady PBC's risk management policy and guidance to effectively and efficiently apply the appropriate methods, standards, and practices required to protect GovReady PBC IT. To address this challenge, GovReady PBC publishes "Practices" such as this document to its community. 

Practices are available publicly unless they contain specific information that would reasonably be understood as sensitive, proprietary, or tactical that [unethically] compromise GovReady PBC's management of risk.


## Who does what / Responsibilities

GovReady PBC CEO (CEO). The CEO:

1. Can be an individual or individuals recognized in law and organization by laws as the Chief Executive Officer
1. Defines and maintains the organization's risk management strategy, risk tolerance, and risk management resources
2. Communicates risk management strategy and risk tolerance 
3. Oversees implementation of this practice, directs and oversees the cybersecurity risk management of organization IT, distributes RMF information standards and sharing requirements, and regularly reviews and updates. 
4. Appoints practice agents and delegates to practice agents specific authority to oversee implementation of this practice

GovReady PBC Practice Agent. The Practice Agent:

1. Can be an individual or an organization
2. Oversees implementation of delegated areas of a pratice within the scope of their appointment
3. Continuously and honestly measures[instruments] and shares with CEO, practice agents, and teammates results of implementing the practice
4. Maintains appropriate records of their activities and deliverables
5. Reasonably assigns activities and deliverables to members of the GovReady PBC community to implement the practice

GovReady PBC Employees and Contractors (Team member). The Teammember:

1. Can be an individual or an organization
2. Agrees to continuously and honestly abide by this practice and all pertentant related policies, guidance, methods, standards (including professional industry standards and applicable laws)
3. Agrees to continuously and honestly contribute to the measuring and sharing with CEO, practice agents, and teammates implementing the practice
4. Maintains appropriate records of their activities and deliverables as required by implementation of the practice
5. Reasonably contributes to activities and deliverables advantageous to implementing the practice.
6. Reduces risk by accurately using only IT authorized and categorized appropriate level of confidentialilty, integrity, and availability to store, process, or transit protected information under GovReady PBC custody and not increase risk by allowing protected information under GovReady PBC's custody to be used (e.g., stored, processed, transmitted) in IT not authorized or categorized to the appropriate level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

GovReady PBC Information Technology and Systems (IT). The IT:

1. Can be software, hardware, system, or system of systems (including a system composed of both persons and technology)
2. Continuously and honestly implements this practice and all pertentant related policies, guidance, methods, standards (including professional industry standards and applicable laws)
3. Continuously and honestly measures[instruments] and shares adherance and divergence to implementing the practice
4. Is designed, architected, developed, and operated to implement this practice and all pertentant related policies, guidance, methods, standards (including professional industry standards and applicable laws)


## Organization Risk Tolerance Statement

GovReady PBC risk profile embraces both risk-adverse nature of our stability-oriented government agency customers and the greater risk tolerance associated with start-ups and small businesses that allow them to explore.

We resolve these seemingly opposing values through our belief that exhilarating summits are achieved only through excelling safety.

We believe and practice that improvements in safety enable greater achievement by bringing improved protection and recovery technologies, standards and practices inheritantly adverserial and unstable situations. 

We believing in aggressive and extensive modeling and testing within separate and safe environments so that we can take risks and failing quickly without doing irreversible harm to value and protected assets.

We believe continuous rehearsal and practice in carefuly constructed and real world scenarios leads to the best preparation and performance. We test extensively and restrict and prevent protected information from untested technology. We recognize breaches occur and leverage encryption and segration to limit consequences.

At GovReady PBC, Compliance is not security.  We treat security and compliance as distinct activities. Security genererally is the practice of preparing, preventing, responding, and recovering from avoidable and adverserial malbehaviors. Compliance generally is the practice of scaling reliable attestation and verification of qualities, conditions, and behaivors[performance]. Security sometimes employs secrets as a means to its end; compliance is only possible through sharing.

In short, GovReady PBC actively pursues risk in constrained, reversible environments and scenarios and actively minimizes avoids risk in real world through security in depth approaches.

## Managing Information Security Risk

Because GovReady PBC develops and manages software systems used by the United States government clients, GovReady PBC uses the NIST Risk Management Framework as its primary strategy for managing information security risk.

## Reciprocity

Cybersecurity reciprocity (referred to in this instruction as “reciprocity”) is an essential element in ensuring IT capabilities are developed and fielded rapidly and efficiently across the GovReady PBC extended community. Applied appropriately, reciprocity reduces redundant testing, assessing and documentation, and the associated costs in time and resources. This practice presumes acceptance of existing test and assessment results and authorization documentation. In order to facilitate reciprocity, the following concepts are fundamental to a common understanding and must be adhered to:

a. Information Systems have only a single valid authorization. (Multiple authorizations indicate multiple systems under separate ownership and configuration control.)

b. An Information System and its valid authorization shall clearly define the edges (e.g., boundaries), interfaces (e.g., inter-connects), and other operating environment interactions (e.g., impacts) such that the Information System can be operated in conjuction with or as part of another information system or environment without harming or jeopardy to receiving information system and its valid authorization or environment. 

c. Information Systems that anticipate interacting with other information systems must make their security requirements readily findable and available in accordance with this practice so that others seeking appropriately authorized to operate and interact with the system can self-coordinate their development of systems. (reword intent is to make systems accountable for providing documentation that allows others to operate and interact with the system with a full understanding and acceptance of risk and be able to innovate. The street will find its own use for technology. Also accepting that innovation unknowable.)

d. An authorization decision for and Information System cannot be made without completing the required assessments and analysis, as recorded in the security authorization package. 

e. Deploying organizations must provide the complete security authorization package to receiving organizations. 

f. security authorization documentation will be developed using GovReady tools or other interoperable tools to provide electronic, shared visibility

g. The process for receiving organization to accept IS and PIT systems is:
- (1) Review the complete security authorization package.
- (2) Determine the security impact of connecting the deploying system within the receiving enclave or site.
- (3) Determine the risk of hosting the deploying system within the enclave or site.
- (4) If the risk is acceptable, execute a documented agreement between deploying and receiving organizations (e.g., memorandum of understanding (MOU), memorandum of agreement (MOA), SLA) for the maintenance and monitoring of the security posture of the system (security controls, computer network defense service provider (CNDSP), etc.).
- (5) Document the acceptance by the receiving AO.
