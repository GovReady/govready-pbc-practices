## What is a Practice?

A Practice is a design document providing information to the GovReady PBC community, or describing a new policy for the organization or its processes or environment. The Practice should provide conscise technique description for the policy or process and the rationale for it.

Practices were inspired by [Python PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) approach to coordinating community activities.
